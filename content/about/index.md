Hey there, I'm Adenosine or at least that's what I'm mostly called.

### Interests

1. Programming of course! I code mainly in rust and python.
2. Cybersecurity: especially when it's about low level stuff,
   oh god I **love** buffer overflows.
3. Data hoarding: I *only* have a 4TB hard drive right now,
   but expect huge expansion in the next few months.
4. Astronomy, and physics in general.
5. Gaming: but not that much, Only how far my laptop can go.

### My little projects

1. [Mini OS](https://github.com/doomed-neko/mini-rust-os):
A small operating system written in rust.
2. [VL](https://github.com/doomed-neko/vl): A brainfuck interpreter
